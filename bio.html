        Bogota-Berlin. Thirteen is an infamous number which some cultures have labeled as bad omen.
        Museums around the globe avoid having a room #13. Maybe, it is because the thirteenth arcane
        is Death, but death is what gives meaning to life. One is manifestation and Three is movement,
        together they make Four, which is the force that materializes the divine plans.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project is the embodiment of the number thirteen. A quest to create beauty and find
        healing through the cracks of decadence, producing and selecting music in the framework
        of contemporary heavy-bass, club and deconstructed music, with the roots embedded in Colombia.
      </p>

        Co-founder of the Label RUTA, and the Colombian party series Renata Rave, Trexeter has navigated
        the scenes of Bogota and Berlin for over 8 years. With releases in his two labels and MUAKK,
        he explores an immigrant identity through new latin electronics, layered breaks and powerful subs.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had radio experiences with a residency on Internet Public Radio and a series of takeovers
        in Refuge Worldwide, where he showcases RUTA’s vision on a more contemplative set up.
